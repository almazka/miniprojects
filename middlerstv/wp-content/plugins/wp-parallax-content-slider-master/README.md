# WordPress Parallax Content Slider

A customizable JQuery content slider with CSS3 animations and parallax effects.

## Features

* The Plugin is fully-based on the WordPress [Plugin API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API)
* i18n support: Ready for translation using .po files (http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers)
* WPML support: Queries, option management and strings declaration are made to work with [WPML](http://wpml.org/documentation/theme-compatibility/go-global-program/)
* Adds automatically a content slider of your last posts where you want on your WordPress blog or website
* Shortcode support
* Transitions between slides are made using a powerfull combination of CSS3 and JQuery to display a beautiful parallax effect
* Very easy to configure as it adds automatically an admin page in WordPress administration section
* Offers the possibility to choose to display a static HTML content instead of displaying last posts in the slider

Some of the parameters you can manage in the admin section are listed below:
* The type of content to display (posts, pages, both) ;
* The number of slides to display ;
* The auto-switch mode ;
* The time between each slide ;
* The sort order of the content to display ;
* The graphic theme ;
* and many more...

## Usage

### First installation

Download ZIP file and simply follow the instructions [here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-parallax-content-slider/installation/)

### Automatic update

Only official releases will be deployed on the Wordpress.org SVN repository and then automatically updatable.

Be careful, if you decide to upgrade automatically the plugin, be sure to backup your customized files, especially 'style.css' and 'static-slides-sample.php'. Automatic update will replace these files and you might lose your stuff!

## Roadmap

If you want to help me or contribute to this project, I'll consider all requests, suggestions and pull requests from users and developpers.

### TODOs

* Code improvement
* Add new translations files ([Contact me on twitter](http://twitter.com/JulienLeThuaut/) if you want to help or add your language on [transifex](https://github.com/jlethuau/wp-parallax-content-slider/wiki/Translations) :)
* Use a new custom post type "Parallax slide" to manage static slides instead of the old static HTML file
